### Background
I designed this app for event organisers. With rising costs of everything it is increasingly difficult to contribute to communities, keep entries from sky rocketing and run a race without going bankrupt. So, I decided to develop a web app which will allow anyone from race organisers, charities and clubs to run a cost effective system and succesful races.

In addition, from a branding point of view, you are not sharing your space with anyone else. You are not a sub domain of another business or someone else's property to dictate how you run your business. Nor are your entries being intercepted by a commission system. With this system you are your own entity, your own unique brand.

Finally, I'm neurodivergent and having multiple versions of the truth is incredibly draining no, thats not it, its utterly exhausting. As an organiser, typically you have to update operationally different systems with the same information. This includes: Accounting software, entry system, timing system, results system, website, social media etc...... Removing some of this cognitive burden and condensing into one app will be a relief!

### Stack
Django framework which is a comprehensive tech stack out of the box.
