# Requirement
I designed this app for event organisers. With rising costs of everything it is increasingly difficult to contribute to communities, keep entries from sky rocketing and run a race without going bankrupt. So, I decided to develop a web app which will allow anyone from race organisers, charities to clubs to run a cost effective system.
