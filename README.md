## Western Bike Events Event Management Web App
Capstone event management application built using Django framework. 

### Warning
Ensure you follow all laws and codes of practice in your country when processing personal and sensitive data if you decide to use this repo in your project. Security should be your top priority. I am not responsible if you have a breach.

### Maintenance Status
This is an open source project and I'm a complete noob, it is not a maintained product. There is probably better ways of doing things but I will try to keep it up to date. I welcome contributions from the wider community. If you're interested, please get in touch.

### Difficulty 
To deploy this project will require some famailiarality with VS Code and Django in order to deploy this repo. 

### Requirement
I designed this app for event organisers. With rising costs of everything it is increasingly difficult to contribute to communities, keep entries from sky rocketing and run a race without going bankrupt. So, I decided to develop a web app which will allow anyone from race organisers, charities and clubs to run a cost effective system and succesful races.

In addition, I'm neurodivergent and having multiple versions of the truth is incredibly draining. As an organiser, typically you have to update operationally different systems with the same information. This includes: Accounting software, entry system, timing system, results system, website, social media etc...... Removing some of this cognitive burden and condensing into one app will be a relief!

### Vision
A lightningly fast, responsive and lightweight in appearance web app with awesome SEO and analytics using bootstrap 5.

### Stack
Django framework which is a comprehensive tech stack out of the box.
