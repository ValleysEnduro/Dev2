## Maintenance Status
This is an open source project it is not a maintained product. I will try to keep it up to date but I welcome contributions from the wider community. If you're interested, please get in touch.

## Difficulty 
To deploy this project will require some famailiarality with MS VS Code and Django in order to deploy this repo. 

## Requirement
I designed this app for event organisers. With rising costs of everything it is increasingly difficult to contribute to communities, keep entries from sky rocketing and run a race without going bankrupt. So, I decided to develop a web app which will allow anyone from race organisers, charities and clubs to run a cost effective system and succesful races.

## Vision
A lightningly fast and lightweight in appearance web app with awesome SEO and analytics using bootstrap 5.

## Stack
Django framework which is a comprehensive tech stack out of the box.
